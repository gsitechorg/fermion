# The global random seed used. This is a 64-bit integer. If not set, a random
# one is chosen using the system random device.
# seed: 10095974290794820456

# The maximum number of successful test cases to run before deciding that a
# property holds. Defaults to 100.
max_success: 10

# The maximum size to use. The size starts at 0 and increases to max_size as the
# final value. Defaults to 100.
# max_size: 100

# The maximum number of discarded test cases per successful test case. If
# exceeded, RapidCheck gives up on the property. Defaults to 10.
# max_discard_ratio: 10

# If set to 1, disables test case shrinking. Defaults to 0.
# noshrink: 0

# If set to 1, enables verbose feedback of progress during the testing of a
# property. For each test case that is run, a character will be printed. Default
# is 0. Legend:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   (o) . - Success
#   (o) x - Discarded
verbose_progress: 1

# If set to 1, enables verbose feedback during shrinking. For each shrink that
# is tried, a character will be printed. Default is 0. Legend:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   (o) . - Unsuccessful shrink
#   (o) ! - Successful shrink
verbose_shrinking: 1

# Opaque string that encodes the information necessary to reproduce minimal
# failures for properties. Since this string is opaque, it can only be obtained
# from a failed RapidCheck run. Refer to the debugging documentation for more
